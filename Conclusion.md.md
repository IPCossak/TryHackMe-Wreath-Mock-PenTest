# Conclusion 


This penetration test revealed that the network is highly vulnerable, allowing an external attacker to gain an initial foothold by exploiting the public-facing web server. Once inside, we were able to escalate privileges, which lead to compromising all three machines with administrative access. Furthermore, we successfully exfiltrated sensitive credentials and source code from the client's git server, demonstrating the potential for severe data theft or destruction, including ransomware attacks.

We strongly recommend prioritizing the patching of the vulnerable Webmin service on host 10.200.85.200, as it serves as a critical entry point for attackers. Additionally, addressing all other critical vulnerabilities identified during this assessment is essential to protect the network from further exploitation.

To mitigate future risks, we recommend to implement a robust patch management system which will help to prevent the exploitation of new vulnerabilities. Implementing an IDS/IPS or a WAF is also advised to enable early detection of compromises. Regular vulnerability scanning should be conducted to ensure outdated services are promptly identified and remediated.

Please note that this assessment represents a snapshot in time, reflecting the security posture during the period of testing. We were unable to test every identified vulnerability due to the sheer amount, so after hardening the network, another security assessment is recommended to ensure comprehensive protection.
