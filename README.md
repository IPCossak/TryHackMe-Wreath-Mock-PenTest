# Mock Penetration Test and Walkthrough - TryHackMe-Wreath

## Description
This repository contains a mock penetration test report and a walkthrough of the TryHackMe "Wreath" lab. This lab primarily focuses on getting an initial foothold on a public facing webserver, and then pivoting through the network. I assume anyone reading this will want to attempt the lab themselves, and so will not include further details as they are dicussed in the lab itself. This is also my first attempt at a pentest report so it was a great experience and I hope to practice a lot more soon. I would also encourage anyone doing this lab to try out all the different techniques explained especially when it comes to pivoting and port forwarding. I have not included all in my attack narrative walkthrough, as this was more of a pentest report writing exercise for me. 

## Project Structure
- Each section of a typical pentest report has it's own folder and the main file is 'WreathPentestFinal'.

## Prerequisites
- Access to TryHackMe

## Additional Notes

- I have not included the C2 section here, but will aim to upload a walkthrough soon. ![DogHuskyGIF](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e3f2939-8630-435b-b625-c75d7b5e8c13)
