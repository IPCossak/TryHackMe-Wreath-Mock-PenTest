# Cleanup 

After all our testing was complete, we proceeded to remove any imported tools, files and modifications we made on all the hosts in the network. 

- On the webserver (10.200.85.200) we deleted the binary of socat (socat-custom) and netcat (nc-custom).

- We also removed the open port 23456 on the firewall we had added for the reverse shell.

- On the git-server (10.200.85.150) we deleted the web shell (exploit-verylegit1.php) and also the chisel binary (chisel-custom.exe). 

- We deleted the firewall rule (chisel-verylegit) that opened the port 17000

- We also removed the temporary user that we created to login with RDP (verylegit)

- On the personal PC (10.200.85.100) we deleted netcat (nc-custom), the netcat wrapper (wrapper.exe), the web shell (shell-verylegit.jpg.php), winPEAS (winpeas-custom.exe) and removed the SMB share
