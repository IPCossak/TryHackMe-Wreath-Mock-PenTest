# Executive Summary

We were asked by Mr. Thomas Wreath to test the security of his lab environment, which includes a public web server, a Git server, and his personal PC. The goal was to find any vulnerabilities and see what an external attacker might be able to compromise. By the end of the test, we found many vulnerabilities, and that an attacker could gain full control over all the machines in the network.
